# The UI Finesse Playbook  
Opinionated UI design system and implementation playbook focused on interaction finesse, typography, and component standards for high-clarity product interfaces.
### Shadows, Borders, Surfaces, Backgrounds, and Micro-Details for Product UI

A practical, implementation-focused reference for building high-polish UI:

- Shadow borders that align perfectly with element size
- Realistic shadow stacks with negative spread
- Inner highlights and reflections for dark mode
- Concentric radii, macOS-style buttons, glass surfaces
- Gradient and texture techniques for backgrounds
- Detailed table, form, and component refinements
- Typography, color, spacing, and process heuristics

Use this like a mini design system guideline for both Figma and code.
