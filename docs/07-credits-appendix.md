## AI-Assisted Design Tools

### Rams

**Contributions**: Accessibility and visual design review framework. Provides structured WCAG 2.1 audits covering critical issues (missing alt text, icon-only buttons, form labels, semantic markup), serious issues (focus outlines, keyboard handlers, color-only information, touch targets), and visual design checks (layout, typography, color contrast, component states).
