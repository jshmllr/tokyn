# Agentic UI Workflow

This rule orchestrates the entire UI development process. It detects the project mode and guides you through each phase.

## Phase 0: Mode Detection

Before starting any UI work, determine which mode applies:

### Enhancement Mode (Existing Component Library)
Detected when ANY of these are true:
- `components/ui/button.tsx` exists (shadcn/ui pattern)
- `@radix-ui/*` packages in dependencies
- `@headlessui/*` packages in dependencies
- `@chakra-ui/*` packages in dependencies
- `@mantine/*` packages in dependencies

### Standalone Mode (Greenfield)
Detected when NONE of the above are present.

---

## Phase 1: Context Gathering

**ALWAYS start here before building UI.**

Run the `teach-impeccable` command to establish design context:

- Target audience and use cases
- Brand personality (3 words)
- Aesthetic direction and references
- Anti-references (what to avoid)

If `.cursorrules` already contains a `## Design Context` section, skip this phase.

---

## Phase 2: Foundation

### Standalone Mode

1. Check if `/tokens/` directory exists
   - If not, create tokens using `/tokens/primitives.css` and `/tokens/semantic.css` as templates
2. Follow composition patterns in `/patterns/composition.md`
3. Follow theme architecture in `/patterns/theming.md`

### Enhancement Mode

1. Use the library's existing token system (do not create parallel tokens)
2. Follow extension patterns in `/patterns/extension.md`
3. Reference `/patterns/elevation.md` for transcending defaults

---

## Phase 3: Building

For every component, follow this sequence:

### 3.1 Aesthetic Direction
Consult the `frontend-design` skill:
- Commit to a bold aesthetic direction
- Avoid the "AI slop" anti-patterns
- Make distinctive, memorable choices

### 3.2 Interaction Patterns
Follow `interface-guidelines` rule:
- Keyboard accessibility (WAI-ARIA APG)
- Touch targets (≥24px desktop, ≥44px mobile)
- Form behavior and validation
- Animation constraints

### 3.3 Visual Techniques
Reference `/docs/` for specific techniques:
- `/docs/01-shadow-borders.md` — Shadow stacks, colored shadows, depth
- `/docs/02-surface-detailing.md` — Inner highlights, glass effects, micro-shadows
- `/docs/03-backgrounds-texture.md` — Noise, gradients, patterns
- `/docs/04-components-layout.md` — Tables, dropdowns, modals
- `/docs/05-typography-color.md` — Type hierarchy, color systems

### 3.4 Composition
- NEVER duplicate component styles
- Wrap and extend existing components
- Use variant props over new components
- Design tokens as single source of truth

---

## Phase 4: Refinement

After building, run these commands in sequence:

### 4.1 Polish Pass
Run `polish` command:
- Visual alignment and spacing
- Typography consistency
- Color and contrast verification
- Interaction state completeness
- Micro-interactions and transitions

### 4.2 Design Audit
Run `audit` command:
- Systematic design review
- Identify gaps and inconsistencies
- Verify against aesthetic direction

### 4.3 Accessibility Review
Run `rams` command:
- WCAG 2.1 compliance check
- Critical issues (missing alt, unlabeled inputs)
- Serious issues (focus outlines, keyboard handlers)
- Visual design issues (contrast, spacing)

---

## Phase 5: Quality Gate

Before shipping, complete `ui-checklist.md`:

- [ ] All checklist items verified
- [ ] Or explicitly deferred with rationale
- [ ] No critical accessibility issues
- [ ] Passes the "AI slop test"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Building
- Starting without design context
- Copying styles instead of wrapping components
- Hardcoding colors/spacing instead of using tokens
- Ignoring the component library's patterns

### Aesthetics
- Generic "AI slop" (purple gradients, glowing accents, Inter font)
- Glassmorphism everywhere
- Same-sized card grids
- Gradient text on metrics

### Process
- Skipping the polish pass
- Ignoring accessibility review
- Not completing the checklist
- Shipping without testing all states
